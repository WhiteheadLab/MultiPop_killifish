This folder contains site and treatment data for the four populations.

At 7 days post fertilization (dpf), heart rates (beats per minute; BPM) of three-randomly
chosen embryos per replicate container were recorded by counting ventricular contractions for 30
seconds. Heart rates were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA testing for the main effects of
population, HEWAF concentration, and the interaction of population and HEWAF
concentration. Post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) were performed to identify population and HEWAF
treatment groups with divergent cardiac responses to crude oil exposure.
