This folder contains site and treatment data for the four populations.

At 7 days post fertilization (dpf), heart rates (beats per minute; BPM) of three-randomly chosen embryos per replicate container were recorded by counting ventricular contractions for 30 seconds. Heart rates were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA testing for the main effects of population, HEWAF concentration, and the interaction of population and HEWAF concentration. Post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) were performed to identify population and HEWAF treatment groups with divergent cardiac responses to crude oil exposure.

Embryos (n = 5) were collected for transcriptomic analyses from 3 replicate containers and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen at pre-hatch/onset of eye and pectoral fin movement (~10-14 dpf). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using NEBNext Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Cat # E7420L) and libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 as paired end 150-bp reads at the UC Davis Core Genomics Facility.


Variants were estimated from 40 embryos from LA-REF, 39 embryos from LA-DWH, 39 embryos from TX-REF, and 37 embryos from TX-SF. We estimated genome-wide pairwise Fst values between each population using Weir and Cockerhamâ€™s calculations and vcftools v0.1.16 and averaging Fst values across all variant sites.
